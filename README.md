**My Thoughts:**
As someone who has had a family member affected by lung cancer, its great to see that algorithms are helping increase efficiency while decreasing room for error, especially since waiting for treatments can often take a very long time. While there is still much to improve on in this particular context, the increase in both speed and consistency is still good progress with respect to Artificial Intelligence in the medical field. I'm excited to see how Machine Learning and Artificial Intelligence will continue to improve and become applicable in other related fields of study.
